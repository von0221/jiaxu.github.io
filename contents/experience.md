**October 2023 – June 2025 | BIT**  
#### Contributions:  
- CLIP-MSM Oct 2024 – Apr 2025：

    - Proposed a CLIP-based multi-semantic mapping framework that enables hypothesis-free, fine-grained, and more accurate prediction and interpretation of human high-level visual cortex responses to natural images.
    - Applied CLIP Dissection and normalize the semantic mapping score to achieve the mapping, which demonstrate better interpretability accuracy compared to Network Dissection.
    - Research outcomes contribute to a AAAI 2025 acception and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation’s “Qiyan”Program.
- BrainLMM Mar 2025 – Present:
    - Introduced a label-free multi-semantic mapping framework that combines diverse vision encoders with a Describe-and-Dissect strategy to predict and interpret human high-level visual cortex responses without predefined labels.
    - Research outcomes contribute to a AAAI 2026 acception and National University Student Innovation & Entrepreneurship Development Program.
- SAE-BrainMap May 2025 – Present
    - Developed a hypothesis-free framework that aligns deep neural network representations with human fMRI responses at voxel-level resolution, without relying on downstream prediction tasks.
    - Employed methods such as AutoDecoder and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to enable more interpretable cross-model.
    - Constructed a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most similar SAE feature to each voxel and exhibit ROI-consistent selectivity. comparisons of prediction outcomes.
